# XGboost_Model
This project implements XGBoost, Gradient Descent, and a Voting Classifier to enhance prediction accuracy. XGBoost leverages gradient boosting for high performance, Gradient Descent optimizes model parameters, and the Voting Classifier combines predictions from multiple models for robust and reliable classification.
